# SetupLab Installation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Node.js Installation (MSI Error 1603)
- **Issue**: MSI Error 1603 during Node.js installation
- **Fix**: Already handled in SetupLabCore.psm1 with retry logic after 5-second wait
- **Location**: SetupLabCore.psm1:402-410

### 2. GitHub Desktop Validation
- **Issue**: Post-installation validation failed due to %USERNAME% in executable path
- **Fix**: Removed executable path validation, rely on registry check only
- **File**: software-config.json - set executablePath to null

### 3. Claude CLI Installation
- **Issue**: "Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Path' because it is an empty string"
- **Fix**: Removed executable path from validation for CUSTOM install type
- **File**: software-config.json - set executablePath to null

### 4. Sysinternals Download Script
- **Issue**: Syntax errors in string concatenation and error handling
- **Fix**: Fixed string concatenation for PATH environment variable
- **Files**: Download-Sysinternals.ps1:128, 164

### 5. Execution Policy in Web Launcher
- **Issue**: Scripts blocked by execution policy on remote machines
- **Fix**: Added execution policy bypass at the beginning of web launcher
- **File**: SetupLab-WebLauncher-NoCache.ps1:9-13

### 6. Missing Files in Web Launcher
- **Issue**: SetupLabLogging.psm1 and install-claude-cli.ps1 not downloaded
- **Fix**: Added both files to the download list
- **File**: SetupLab-WebLauncher-NoCache.ps1:131-134, 184-188

## Remote Testing Setup

### Prerequisites
- Remote machine: setuplab01.xyz.local (198.18.1.157)
- Credentials: xyz\administrator / Default1234
- Both machines on same domain (xyz.local)
- WinRM enabled on remote machine
- Windows Firewall disabled on remote machine

### Testing Scripts Created
1. `test-remote-setuplab.ps1` - Basic connectivity test
2. `test-remote-quick.ps1` - Quick validation test
3. `run-remote-setuplab.ps1` - Full installation runner with monitoring

### How to Run Remote Installation
```powershell
# Test connectivity first
.\test-remote-setuplab.ps1

# Run full installation
.\run-remote-setuplab.ps1

# Or just test without installing
.\run-remote-setuplab.ps1 -TestOnly
```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Network Connectivity**: Some installations may fail if the remote machine has restricted internet access
2. **Installation Time**: Full installation takes 10-15 minutes
3. **Logging**: Enhanced logging writes to C:\ProgramData\SetupLab\Logs with detailed error tracking
4. **Silent Installation**: All installers configured for silent/unattended installation

## Branch Information
All fixes committed to branch: `enhanced-logging-remote-testing`
Based on: `serial-install-improvements`
